### What I learned

When i'm working through this project I learn new CSS property (which is background-repeat: space), not actually a new property cause I use (background-repeat: no-repeat) to clear background repetition but i didn't know by that time so, through this project i do.

```html
<div class="star">
  <div class="star-img">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
```

```css
.star-img {
  background-image: url(images/icon-star.svg);
  background-size: 2rem 2rem;
  background-repeat: space;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://chipcullen.com/background-repeat-and-its-possibilities/) - This helped me for figure out how i can set a space between background-image reason.
